Define Rn to be the maximum amount earned by cutting a rod of length n meters into one or more pieces of integer length and selling them. For i>0, let p[i] denote the selling price of a rod whose length is i meters. Consider the array of prices:

p[1]=1,p[2]=5,p[3]=8,p[4]=9,p[5]=10,p[6]=17,p[7]=18
Which of the following statements is/are correct about R7?

1.R7=18
2.R7=19
3.R7 is achieved by three different solutions
4.R7 cannot be achieved by a solution consisting of three pieces
